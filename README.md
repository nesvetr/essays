Varney the Vampire
A Blog Post
By James Malcolm Rymer

I hate my former publishe [G.W.M. Reynolds.](https://gwmreynoldssociety.com/) He is suing me and my once and current publisher Edward Lloyd and his business partner/sock puppet Charles Jones. Reynolds is also a Red Republican Socialist. And a vampire. He said this:

> The dense black clouds were driving restlessly athwart the sky; and when the vivid lightning gleamed forth with rapid and eccentric glare, it seemed as if the dark jaws of some hideous monster, floating high above, opened to vomit flame.

That is a lot like the opening of my hit serial *Ada, the Betrayed*!
